If you like your fried potatoes golden brown, Yukon Gold will almost turn that color by themselves.

Dr. Burbank even admitted he was fortunate to have bred this cultivar.\n\t\t\tRed Pontiac\n\t\t\tEasy and adaptable red potato for home gardening. Most likely the easiest and most adaptable red potato there is to grow, not to mention the consistent flavor! Attractive deep red skin and eyes, white flesh. The tuber of choice for new potatoes or fresh eating. Red Pontiac came from Florida in 1945 so it grows well in both the South and North regions.\n\t\t\tKennebec Potato Seeds\n\t\t\tOne of the most popular potatoes grown by home gardeners.\u00a0High yields of large, white skin, white fleshed tubers that grow well under harsh conditions. Kennebecs are superb boiled, mashed, fried, hashed or baked. Good jacket potato - smoother it in sour cream, cheese, chives and bacon. It's absolutely perfect.\n\t\t\tIf it is late in the season and we are out of a variety above, we will substitute the next closest variety."

American Giant Hybrid was developed especially to respond to your best gardening efforts. It is a huge (and we mean, huge) improvement on the old garden varieties that you nursed along in the garden only to see them fall to the ground with the first big wind after flowering. American Giant Hybrid grows tall and stays standing long after the others fall. In fact, you may have to literally get out a saw and cut it down at the end of the year. Or leave it through the winter for the birds and squirrels to enjoy the seeds and to remind your neighbors of your gardening prowess. Don\u2019t believe that the American Giant is a huge sunflower? We have seen it grow as tall as 17 feet! Now, that is a large sunflower."
